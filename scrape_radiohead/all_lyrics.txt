You are the sun and moon and stars are you,
and I could never run away from you.
You try at working out chaotic things,
and why should I believe myself not you?
It's like the world is going to end so soon,
and why should I believe myself?
You me and everything caught in the fire,
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.
You me and everything caught in the fire,
and I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.
Drill EP lyrics: 
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?
You say the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Hey, the sun and moon and stars are
Yeah, but I won't share myself with you, you
To, me, ooh...

When you were here before,
couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel,
your skin makes me cry.
You float like a feather,
in a beautiful world
I wish I was special,
you're so fucking special.
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control.
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice,
when I'm not around.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special.
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?.
I don't belong here
She's running out the door,
she's running,
she run, run, run, run, run.
Whatever makes you happy,
whatever you want.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special,
but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here.

He's bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants.
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong.
He wants you to listen, he wants us to weep.
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak.
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
He lives with his mother, but we show him respect.
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget.
And he's just like his daddy, 'cause he cheats on his friends.
And he steals and he bullies, any way that he can.
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
 

And the wise men say "I don't want to hear your voice."
And the thin men say "I don't want to hear your voice."
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be.
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
And my mother say "We spit on your son some more."
And the buildings say "We spit on your face some more."
And the feeling is that there's something wrong,
'cause I can't find the words, and I can't find the songs.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint,
can't remember what it is,
doesn't matter anyway.
Doesn't matter anyway.
 

Been thinking about you, your records are here,
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.
But I'm still no-one, and you're now a star,
what do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,
shit I still love you, still see you in bed.
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
when the other men are far, far better.
All the things you've got,
all the things you need,
who bought you cigarettes,
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet.
They don't know what I know and why should you care
when I'm not there.
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,
should I still love you, still see you in bed.
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care,
when I'm not there.
All the things you've got,
she'll never need,
all the things you've got.
I've bled and I bleed to please you.
 

Destiny, destiny protect me from the world.
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
and I don't see no confusion anywhere.
And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.
Grow my hair, grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison,
grow my hair, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
and I don't see no confusion anywhere.
And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.
 

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys.
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed.
You're free until you drop,
you're free until you've had enough
and you don't understand.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no ripcord.
Aeroplane do I mean what I mean?
Oh it's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane.
A thousand miles an hour
on politics and power
that she don't understand.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no ripcord.
The answer to your prayers,
we'll drop you anywhere.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no no no no ripcord,
oh yeah.
 

I never wanted anything but this,
I worked hard, tried hard.
I ran around in domestic bliss,
I fought hard, died hard.
Everytime you're running out of here,
everytime you're running I get the fear.
I never wanted any broken bones,
scarred face, no home.
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate,
and I burn all hate.
Everytime you're running out on me
everytime you're running I can see.
I'm not a veg'table,
I will not control myself.
I spit on the hand that feeds me,
I will not control myself.
The waters break, the waters run all over me.
The waters break, the waters run
and this time you're gonna pay.
I'm not a veg'table,
I will not control myself.
I spit on the hand that feeds me,
I will not control myself.
 

I can't afford to breathe in this town,
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand.
Hooked back up to the cathode ray,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
I want to breathe, I want to grow,
I'd say I want it but I don't know how.
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray,
but I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
Woh
 

Please forget the words that I just blurted out,
it wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt,
it keeps rattling my cage.
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down,
and even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Soon your things that keep, that keep me underground,
so many words that I, that I can never find.
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't,
even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
 

I feel better, I feel better now you've gone.
I got better, I got better, I got strong.
I feel better, I feel better now there's nothing wrong.
I got better, I got better, I got strong.
Tell me something, tell me something I don't know.
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing, and let it go.
I got something, I got something, heaven knows.
I got something, I got something, I don't know.
 

In my mind and nailed into my heels.
All the time killing what I feel.
And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
turns to stone.
And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
turns stone.
I am fused just in case I blow out.
I am glued just because I crack out.
Everything I touch turns to stone.
Everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
 

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
But still
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
 

Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
Cos I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends
Am I really sinking this low
My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines,
To blow me away, to blow me sky high
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race
Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you
 

Two jumps in a week,
I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle,
watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition,
kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror,
you're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation,
you'll be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces,
you just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit on you,
you'll be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had,
the best thing that you ever, ever had.
It's the best thing that you ever had,
the best thing you have had has gone away.
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high,
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
 

A green plastic watering can
For a fake chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
On girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time, all the time
 

I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
 

They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She says she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
[Just as well Just as well Just as well]
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
 

Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the 15th floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, yourself, yourself.
 

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm recieving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep
To cynical to speak
We are losing it
Can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for
Our iron lung
The head shrinkers
They want everything
My uncle Bill
My Belisha beacon
The head shrinkers
They want everything
My uncle Bill
My Belisha beacon
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out
We'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
The head shrinkers
They want everything
My uncle Bill
My Belisha beacon
The head shrinkers
They want everything
My uncle Bill
My Belisha beacon
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
The head shrinkers
They want everything
My uncle Bill
My Belisha beacon
 

Limb by limb, tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bullet proof,
was bullet proof
So pay the money and take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
 

I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you.
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?
blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home.
the troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you.
I try to stay awake but its 58hours since that I last slept with you.
what are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore.
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you.
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you.
what am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
 

You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
You are so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected, eager to please
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, Drift away
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, You'll never change
 

Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see it's beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love.
 

In the next world war
in a jack knifed juggernaut,
I am born again.
In the neon sign,
scrolling up and down,
I am born again.
In an interstellar burst,
I am back to save the universe.
In a deep deep sleep,
of the innocent,
I am born again.
In a fast German car,
I'm amazed that I survived,
an airbag saved my life.
In an interstellar burst,
I am back to save the universe.
In an interstellar burst,
I am back to save the universe.
In an interstellar burst,
I am back to save the universe.
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does....
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height... height...
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height... height...
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
That's it, sir
You're leaving
The crackle of pigskin
The dust and the screaming
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit
The panic, the vomit
God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting.
The smell of the warm summer air.
I live in a town
where you can't smell a thing,
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement.
Up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home,
of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits,
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets.
They're all uptight, uptight,
uptight, uptight,
uptight, uptight.
I wish that they'd sweep down in a country lane,
late at night when I'm driving.
Take me on board their beautiful ship,
show me the world as I'd love to see it.
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me,
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely.
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life.
They'd shut me away.
But I'd be alright, alright,
I'd be alright,
I'm alright.
I'm just uptight, uptight,
uptight, uptight,
uptight, uptight,
uptight, uptight,
uptight.
Wake from your sleep,
the drying of your tears,
Today we escape, we escape.
Pack and get dressed
before your father hears us,
before all hell breaks loose.
Breathe, keep breathing,
don't lose your nerve.
Breathe, keep breathing,
I can't do this alone.
Sing us a song,
a song to keep us warm,
there's such a chill, such a chill.
And you can laugh a spineless laugh,
we hope your rules and wisdom choke you.
And now we are one
in everlasting peace,
we hope that you choke, that you choke,
we hope that you choke, that you choke,
we hope that you choke, that you choke.
Transport, motorways and tramlines,
starting and then stopping,
taking off and landing,
the emptiest of feelings,
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles,
and when it comes it's so, so, disappointing.
Let down and hanging around,
crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.
Shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going,
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel.
One day, I'm gonna grow wings,
a chemical reaction,
hysterical and useless
hysterical and
let down and hanging around,
crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.
Let down,
Let down,
Let down.
You know, you know where you are with,
you know where you are with,
floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back
and one day, I'm gonna grow wings,
a chemical reaction, [You know where you are,]
hysterical and useless [you know where you are,]
hysterical and [you know where you are,]
let down and hanging around,
crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.
Karma police

he buzzes like a fridge,
he's like a detuned radio.
Karma police

her Hitler hairdo

This is what you get,

I've given all I can,
it's not enough,
I've given all I can
but we're still on the payroll.
This is what you get,

this is what you get,
when you mess with us.
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself.
Phew, for a minute there,
I lost myself, I lost myself.
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself.
Phew, for a minute there,
I lost myself, I lost myself.

Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote.
When I go forwards you go backwards
and somewhere we will meet.
When I go forwards you go backwards
and somewhere we will meet.
Ha ha ha
Riot shields, voodoo economics,
it's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F.
I trust I can rely on your vote.
When I go forwards you go backwards
and somewhere we will meet.
When I go forwards you go backwards

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Put the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
A heart that's full up like a landfill,
a job that slowly kills you,
bruises that won't heal.
You look so tired-unhappy,
bring down the government,
they don't, they don't speak for us.
I'll take a quiet life,
a handshake of carbon monoxide,
with no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
Silent silence.
This is my final fit,
my final bellyache,
with no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises please.
Such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden.
No alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises please.

I'm on a roll,
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change.
Kill me Sarah,
kill me again with love,
it's gonna be a glorious day.
Pull me out of the aircrash,
Pull me out of the lake,
I'm your superhero,
we are standing on the edge.
The head of state has called for me by name
but I don't have time for him.
It's gonna be a glorious day!
I feel my luck could change.
Pull me out of the aircrash,
Pull me out of the lake,
I'm your superhero,
we are standing on the edge.
We are standing on the edge.
It barks at no-one else but me,
like it's seen a ghost.
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin,
no-one else would know.
Hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down.
Sometimes I get overcharged,
that's when you see sparks.
They ask me where the hell I'm going?
At a 1000 feet per second,
hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down.
Hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down.

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie
We've got heads on sticks

Fireworks and hurricanes

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get back where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Original last verse not included on Kid A:
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you
I think you're crazy, maybe (x6)
I will see you in the next life

After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize
I'm a reasonable man
get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting
After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize your looking, looking in the wrong place
I'm a reasonable man
get off my case, get off my case

get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

I jumped in the river and what did I see?
black-eyed angels swimming with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
all the figures I used to see
all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships
And there are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors
And there are secret doors
There are doors that lock
And doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out
But never open
And there are trapdoors
That you can't come back from

Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
You forget so easy
We ride tonight
Ghost horses

I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming home
I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think
Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and
Never look back
Never look back
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Open up and let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth
If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear witness
We can use
Be constructive
With your blues
Even when its only warnings,
Even when you're talking war games.
Oh Why don’t you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don’t you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children’s land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don’t you quiet down?
(Maybe I’ll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don’t you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children’s land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)"
You don't live in a business world,
you never go out and you never stay in.
We all have goals in a liberal world,
living in times when I can stand it babe.
It's all over baby's crying,
its all over baby.
I can see out of here.
All over the planets dead,
all over the planet, so let me out of here.
All over the world.

While you make pretty speeches,
I'm being cut to shreds.
You feed me to the lions,
a delicate balance
When this just feels like spinning plates.
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land.
And this just feels like spinning plates
Our bodies floating down the muddy river.

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house
Once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in.
Once again, we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in.

Are you such a dreamer?
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two &amp; two always
makes up five
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag &amp; hide
January has April's showers
And two &amp; two always
makes up five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream &amp; you
can shout
It is too late now
Because
You have not been
paying attention
I try to sing along
I get it all wrong
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee
NOT
I swat em like flies but
Like flies the burgers
Keep coming back
NOT
Maybe not
"All hail to the thief"
"But I am not!"
"Don't question my authority
or put me in the dock"
Cozimnot!
Go &amp; tell the king that
The sky is falling in
When it's not
Maybe not.
(ahh diddums.)

Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)

Sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)
Anytime

I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
This far but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink
Oh honey sweet
So full of sleep
I'm backsliding
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking
Ah ah ah
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our, ah
You fell into a
We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

Something for the rag and bone man
"Over my dead body"
Something big is gonna happen
"Over my dead body"
Someone's son or someone's daughter
"Over my dead body"
This is how I end up getting sucked in
"Over my dead body"
I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash all over me
We don't wanna wake monster taking over
"Tiptoe round tie him down"
We don't want the loonies taking over
"Tiptoe round tie them down"
May pretty horses
Come to you
As you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash
All over me

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone.
X' will mark the place
Like parting the waves
Like a house falling in the sea.
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?
We want the young blood
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten? moth-eaten?
We suck young blood
We suck young blood
Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned
We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out the bottle
Funny haha funny how
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down
To the otherside
They will suck you down
To the otherside
They will suck you down

They will suck you down
To the otherside
To the shadows blue and red
To the shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
To the shadows blue and red
To the shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
Should be ringing
This is the gloaming

In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape.
Broken branches trip me as I speak.
Just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there.
Just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there.
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck.
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster.
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there.
(There's someone on your shoulder)
Just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there.
(There's someone on your shoulder)
There there
Why so green and lonely?
Heaven sent you to me.
We are accidents
Waiting waiting to happen.
We are accidents
Waiting waiting to happen.

I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there and it wasn't like that
You came here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn round stay frozen to the spot.
You had to piss on our parade
Uou had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammer-headed sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punchup at a wedding.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I've been where i liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
And screwed me in a vice
But now I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied"
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
"I don’t know why
I feel so tongue-tied
Don’t know why
I feel so skinned alive."
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
"Now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars"
That wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
"I don’t know why
I feel so tongue-tied"

I'm walking out in a force ten gale.
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail.
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails.
Your voice is rapping on my window sill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind.
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain.
Then any fool can easy pick a hole. (I only wish I could fall in)
A moving target in a firing range.
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Lightning fuse
Powercut.
Scatterbrain

Drag him out the window
Dragging out your dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Step up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me call the doctor
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see him again
If I squeal to the cops
Walking like a giant crane and
With my x ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses.
Cold wives and sunday papers.
City boys in 1st class
Don't know we're born
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Oh I wish you'd get up
Go over get up go over and turn this tape off.
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see him again
If I squeal to the cops

How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I went wrong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I went wrong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera
Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a shear drop

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh
You killed the sound
removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
Ooooohhhh
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped around my face
All the lines wrapped around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming

Don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
and feel up with noise
but there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
they're not going to happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
Weird fishes
Get picked over by the worms
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

I'm the next act
waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
that you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth
who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
because there are no others
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong

One two three four
Wakey wakey
rise and shine
it's on again, off again, on again
watch me fall
like dominos
in pretty patterns
fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
it's what you feel now
what you ought to, what you ought to
reasonable and sensible
dead from the neck up
because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
for no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
and take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
it's what you feel now
what you ought to, what you ought to
an elephant that's in the room is
tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
in duplicate and triplicate and
plastic bags and
duplicate and triplicate
dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
exactly where do you get off
is enough, is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
a last stop
there's no real reason
You've got a head full of feathers
you got melted to butter

Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all you
all human beings
Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
(in rainbows)
Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
(in rainbows)
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all you
all human beings

I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table,
Get swept under
Denial, denial
The infrastructure will collapse
Voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table,
And get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
You got a cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before your lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
A Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back and you look back
Not just once
and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light you can feel it on your back
[A light,] you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place

When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
and he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
and i have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green
You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you before
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen.

Instrumental

Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without a warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup
Down is the new up, is the new up
Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up
You crawled off and left us.
You crawled off and left us.
You bastard. You bastard.
You're on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
You crawled off and left us.
You crawled off and left us.
You bastard. You bastard.
You crawled off and left us.
You crawled off and left us.

Over here
Come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient
Patiently
I didn't
But now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out

Instrumental
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me then you'll get relief
relief, relief, relief, ...
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me then you'll get relief
relief, relief, relief, relief...
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much

I'm stuck in the tardis
trapped in hyperspace
one minute snake charming
the next in a motorcade
all the right moves and
earn the right percent
watch me dance like a puppet
you can almost see the strings
give me an answer
give me a sign
i've been climbing up this ladder
i've been wasting my time
so long, so long
so long, so long
up on the ladder
no time to escape
up on the ladder
away for fucking sake
up on the ladder
try to call out your name
up on the ladder
you're all the fucking same
oh, you let the people down
you let the people down
you let the people down

You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me, now I want more
Standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
It's all been sent to recover hell
The bangers and the mash
The negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police or vice-chancellor
Lord and lady, blah blah
The vicar or the judge
You are dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison, and I want more
If you are on top
Then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power
We're changing the hour
If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark
The black will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
When I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
I'm kicking at the wall
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
Poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
I got the poison

This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Steping over heads
Running from the underground
This is your warning
4 minute warning
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
This is a warning
4 minute warning

Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It’s what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt
Don’t blow your mind with why
I’m moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(I dive into those eyes)
I dive into those eye
Jellyfish go by
You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all my magic
Took my memories
(Ooohhhh)
(No no no no no no)
You know you should, but you don’t
You know you should, but you don’t
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
Took my melody
Turned too nasty now
The dark cell
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I’m such a tease
And you’re such a flirt
Once you’ve been hurt
You’ve been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get noticed
Never get judged
I’m no idiot
I should look
Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal
Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get noticed
Never get judged
I’m no idiot
I should look
Little by little by hook or by crook
I’m such a tease
And you’re such a flirt

You are not mine
And I am not yours
And that's okay
Please don't judge me

I would shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I would disappear
I would slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
There’s an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I’ll set you free
I’ll set you free
There’s an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I’ll set you free
I’ll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what it is
I can’t kick the habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice
While the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There’s an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I’ll set you free
I’ll set you free
&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird that's flown in to my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can’t kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart


Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You’ve done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water’s clear and innocent
The water’s clear and innocent


Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)


It’s like I’m falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that’s been carrying me
It’s like I’m falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture
I’m a heart in cold ground
Like I’m falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Finally I’m free of all the weight I’ve been carrying
And as a woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I’m a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that’s been carrying me
I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just a number
I wanna slip it over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Like I’m falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
When I ask you again
When I ask you again
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up


Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions
Easy tumble, easy doll
Easy rumble, easy fall
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions

I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards
I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But Mum and Dad will not give in
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
And now I know just what it is
It's got disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide
Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

What do you want from me now you got me
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace
Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go
You're inside my head
Inside my head
What do you want from me now you got me
Now my energy you suck from me
And I'm holding on for dear life
Quit smothering me
Quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an English disease
It will not go
It will not go
You're inside my head
Inside my head
Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
I won't let go
I won't let go
You're inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head

Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday
Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me
And if it's all right, then what am I doing here?
And if it's all right, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's all right, I'll tell you, because you never understand
And if it's all right, I'll beg you, because I'm a begging kind of man
Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake

Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop
It died an ugly death by back-catalogue
And now you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know, you realize
Oh no, pop is dead, it just gave up
We raised the dead but they won't stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know you're going to die
He left this message for us
So what, pop is dead, it's no great loss
So many facelifts, his face flew off
The emperor really has no clothes on
And his skin is peeling off
Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop
One final line of coke to jack him off
Jack him off
He left this message for us
He left this message for us
He's dead, he's dead, pop is dead
He's dead, he's dead, pop is dead
He's dead, he's dead, pop is dead

I find it hard
To drive your stupid car
I find it hard
Because I never get that far
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
You've got concrete eyes
And I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
Because you crushed me with your hate
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road

I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice
Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car
Or in my hair
I think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
The last time you locked
All the doors
And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice
And yes, I am wary
Yes, I am
I think I've told you once
I think I needed advice
You were such a help
That's very nice
I think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
But this time I kick
Down your door
And yes, I am wary
Yes, I am wary

Oh Banana Co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you
But everything's underground
We got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah
Oh, she said, "No go"
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, no go
She knows if you die then we all do
And everything's underground
We've got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah
Everything's burning down
We got to put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah

Lost in the mountains
Rust in my brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim
Up on the rooftops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak
He's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
I wanted you so bad
That I couldn't say
All these things fall apart
We wanted out so bad
That we couldn't say
These things fall apart
We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Truant kids
A can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from
Their chestnut tree
Long white gloves
Police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo
The perfect child facsimile is
Talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump
Changed shape to fit, in the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it, don't jump
Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really mattered
We never noticed, we never understood
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smelt out the best
It's the best, it's the best day of your life
Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear
Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis

I wrapped you inside my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, because no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust
Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before, I never cared before
I never cared before, before, before, before
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust
I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I don't exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
Is to carry on believing we don't exist
It must be hard, hard, with your head on backwards

I am gone, everybody's raging
And these fruits, they still taste of poison
I won't be around
When you really need me
I can't sleep, why can't someone hold me?
I need warmth, a restless body cracks some more
I won't have the strength
When you really need me

I must get out once in a while
Everything's starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
The spiders crawl over the bed
I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself

Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still
In bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits
On playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back

Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends
And when I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends
When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore

Did it all for you to say
You never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think I'll go plug in the mains
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands
When you spare a make up smile
I'm instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know
That you practiced it beforehand?
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get out of the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
Because they all drive . . .
Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
Because they all drive killer cars
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
No, they won't ever take me alive
Because they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars

Instrumental

Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn
Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience
Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate 5 runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Shake hands, genocide, molasses
Jet powered caravans, molasses
I'm too good, you're stuck on
Rent free earthquake zone, molasses
I need someone else's glasses
Starving waitresses in plasters
Fat houseflies, genocide
We've been stitched up, molasses

I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon this surface for the birds
The birds
The birds
You want me?
Fucking well, come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
You want me?
Well, come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fucking come on and break the door down
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready

If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this
Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me
And if I sat down and crossed my arms
Hold me until this song
Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take the chair and start to talk shit
If I get old remind me of this
That night we kissed and I really meant it
Whatever happens if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song

You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull
There's nothing so dull
As talking, talking about yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull

Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed
We just know that you'll do well
You won't come to harm
Death to all who stand in your way
Wake, my dear

How'd you get your teeth so pearly?
Dew drop dentures
White washed faces
She runs from the third world, pearly
Vanilla (feel it closing in)
Milkshakes (calling back again)
From Hard Rock (whatever you say)
Cafes (make it go away)
That's where (I feel it closing in)
She got her (climbing back again)
Sweet tooth (make it go away)
For white boys (whatever you say)
She runs from the third world, pearly
Use me
Darling, use me
Darling, use me
Darling, use me

Go
Tears of joy now scare ourselves of all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going, how inside you please
If I get scared I'll just call you and I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel, I will always be
Right, one, two, three, four
So sell your suit and tie and come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well
Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe this, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy
Everyone is made for life
In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait
But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too
Everyone one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy, I've been kidding myself for so long
I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too

I was stronger
I was better
Picked you out
Now don't say a word
No, don't yell out
Never mind
Let you out
Led you back
Stay on
Sit down
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall

You're being took for a ride
Plain old lazy
Please keep moving
Better keep moving
Don't fall asleep at the wheel
I'm waiting for you but you never came
Please keep moving
Better keep moving
Please keep moving
Better keep moving

I was born for your magazines
For your magazines
I am trapped in the society page
Of your magazines
Of your magazines
I don't know what it means
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?

Instrumental

I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapse on us
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no one drives
So glad you're mine

I will live a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion
I want to be in the wallpaper
Or run away to the foreign legion
And as the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it any more
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door
I built you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I built you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive
I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear

There's a little child
Running around this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark
Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done how?
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?

You don't want to talk to me
You don't want to say the words
Trying to get off the hook
Trying to get off the hook
Spinning on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away
There's no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want
Take a look around
The candles on the cake
On what might have been
The road you should have took
Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on
It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Find yourself a moment
And go and get some wings
It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Go up, turning around
Go up, turning around
Go and get some wings

I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace
I'll dress like your niece
To wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Just don't leave
Don't leave

I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see
A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, pouring down the street
Move along, theres nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I have sinned and I am so confused and
I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child
I am the devil's son and
I wish I could be good for you
I walk a crooked mile
But I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good
If I could have kept the straight and narrow
If I could have kept the straight and narrow
And not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart
Now I wake up in the night
Lying on my bed
It's tugging at my arms and legs
Like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus
Surely it is time
Send baby Jesus
Let him radiate his light
Radiate his light

I'm looking at you for a minute
900 people die
I'm looking away because
I did and you can't
Why? Because I'm looking back
I'm citizen insane
I'm citizen insane
I'm a citizen now
Look out!
Danger is coming in
How could I?
It is cold, what is near?
Look out!
Danger through me
In the pool, no one in but me
I'm citizen insane
I'm citizen insane
I'm a citizen now
I'm a citizen now
I'm a citizen now
I'm a citizen now
Worry!

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
Blow into this paper bag
Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Come on, come on
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Like they were honeybees or a plague of rats
Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Blow into this paper bag
Blow into this paper bag

You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want
In the sunshine
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone
If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price fells right
I won't judge
If you get off your knees
You'll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dream

I am the only one that got through
The others died where ever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves
I've seen devils coming up from the ground
I've seen hell upon this earth
The next will be chemical but they will never learn

These are my twisted words
When I feel you still walking
I know I should not look down
But I'm so sick of just talking
When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can't stand it
I just can't handle it

Super collider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Parting from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming out from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half light
In a work light
In a B-spin
Flip flopping
In a pulse wave
Outstepping
To put the shadows back into
The boxes
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned my illusions
I have dislodged my depressions
I put the shadows back into
The boxes

Beauty will destroy your mind
Spare the gory details
Give them gift wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life
I was confused
A butcher
I feel nothing
As it courses up my arms
In position of the worms
Up, up through my heart
Into my brain
I'm a big slab a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block
My hearts still pumping
(My hearts still pumping)
He's a warrior
A warrior
Here's a little bitch coming at him
He's a warrior
A warrior
Here's a little bitch coming at him
Coming at him

Heard all about you
Well, hello
Let me shake you by the hand
Just want to say thank you
At least someone has this whole thing sorted out now
At least someone has the right idea
My head is clear
I can see through all the dirt now
My eyes are clear
I can put my see right now
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)
Tell me what I'm doing when I burn your house down
Tell me what I'm doing when I call off all the plans
Someone's got to know what the hell is going on now
Someone's got to know the truth to all of this
My head is clear
I can see through all the dirt now
My eyes are clear
I can put my see right now
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)
Ah, ye happy song
(Come on and talk about it)
Ah, ye happy song
(This is a happy song)

I'm getting sort of worried
like the time of life I've reached
I'm getting pretty old
I should be reaching my peak
but I haven't made the stairs yet
but you know what mean girls say
if you haven't got it when your thirty
that's the way you stay
I can wash and clean the bedrooms
I can make some egg and toast
if you let me stay the night
then I'll let you get some rest
we could talk awhile on the futon
if that's the way you want it
tell me where you want me
tell me where to sit
where to start to build a clock
yeah, I depended on you
I depended on you
to be a brilliant light yeah
to be a brilliant light
to be a brilliant light yeah
to be a brilliant light
bring me in the church
on the corner of your street
I'll be praying for forgiveness
I'll be praying for some love
because I haven't got a job
and my heart's been closed
you could start with the trousers
'cause it's what's stopping the blood flow
where to start to build a clock
I depended on you
I depended on you
to be a brilliant light yeah
to be a brilliant light
to be a brilliant light yeah
to be a brilliant light

hard to port
I can feel the boat
it's harboring unto her brown
sinking ship, man the lifeboats

I made one true day
I may buy you all the things you need
and sleep with you and call you names
but deep down inside
grab a apple on a naked tree
and nothing will ever change
'cause there’s somebody else
though I don’t know who the hell she is
and maybe I love her
but I’m back in my head
I’m somebody else’s buddy prick
won’t somebody just might compromise who I am
there’s somebody there
they were knocking on my forehead
and talking from inside my brain
they’re guiding my thoughts
they’re watching me play with you
and they’ll never go away
'cause there’s somebody else
though I don’t know who the hell she is
and maybe I love her
but I’m back in my head
I’m somebody else’s buddy prick
won’t somebody just might compromise who I am
there’s somebody there
they were knocking on my forehead
and talking from inside my brain
they’re guiding my thoughts
they’re watching me play with you
and they’ll never go away

Millions of people standing like ghosts
Waiting for the entrance sign
To heaven or hell or
Whatever they call
The place of oblivion
After the bomb drops
Death wears a big hat and a thin red tie
He dances in front of all the cameras
Death has a satchel his buddies carry
And in it inside is the key to the world
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Somewhere in Palestine
A crazy angry man wants to rule the world
So he buys himself an atom bomb
And drops it on your head
And you know what he wants
Because you won't have a face to hold on to
Yeah, hold on to
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I don't want to hear about this shit
I don't want to know about your confessions
There's nothing in this life that really means
As much as me and you
And life is so important
And all you're talking about is bombs
Pouring all that money down the drain
We don't want to hear about it
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I don't want to die
Don't want to die
Don't want to die
Oh no
I don't want to die
Don't want to die
Don't want to die
Wooh
I don't want to die
Don't want to die
Don't want to die
Here comes now Mr. B 29
B 29
B 29
Millions of people standing like ghosts
Waiting for the entrance sign
To heaven or hell or
Whatever they call
Place of oblivion
After the bomb
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Oh, here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I don't want to die
Don't want to die

Wooh, sing it
I don't want to die
Don't want to die
Don't want to die
Here she comes now, Mr. B 29
B 29

No longer caught up
Big church wall
Making some noise with a pair of drums
Lying your thoughts out over the sky
Spinning around as you gaze at the sun
(What is that you see?)
Why don't you talk to me?
(What don't you talk to me?)
What is that you see?
(What is that you see?)
Wrapping your fingers around my neck
I see the grass is still when we made our beds
I see the thin weed boy ride at this edge
I see the holy Jesus and the Pharaoh and the Venus
And the ghost of you and me
Gagged and given up for dead
(What is that you see?)
Why don't you talk to me?
(What don't you talk to me?)
What is that you see?
(What is that you see?)
Wrapping your fingers around my neck
There's something up there but I
Don't know what the hell it is
There's something up there
As you guessed
Like the sun
(What is that you see?)
Why don't you talk to me?
(What don't you talk to me?)
What is that you see?
(What is that you see?)
Wrapping your fingers around my neck

Dance sucka, dance sucka, dance sucka, dance
Life is always so fucking violent on the street
But I'm telling you this for your own good
Its because everyone has someone to hate
That just so happens
It happens to be the plan
But everybody has something to hate
Everybody wants just one thing to hate
Everybody got one thing to hate
Everybody wants just one thing to hate, yeah
You said there are no rules on the street, boys
But there's one rule I know real well
(This is just one of them)
Undo your big underhand deals
(Big bad)
Junt
Kathy was a girl I know and she was stabbed
And now she has no arm
Now she has no heart

Shake it now
The life that I choose could be a whole lot better
But I don't give a damn about that
Because being with you is like getting too drunk
Laying ill and I'm falling down flat
I'm upside down
I'm upside down
Here I am on bended knees
Waiting for a word from you
To knock me down
I'm standing around
Like a hanging broken dream
You
Life in your bed can be out of this world
But I don't give a damn about that
Why'd you mind?
Ever since you looked at me,
Said, "Do you really like music like that?"
I'm upside down
I'm upside down
Listen here, I am drunk again
Waiting for a word from you
When you're walking out that door
I ran ahead of you
I can't stop loving you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, all right
I'm upside down
I am upside down
And here I am on bended knees
Waiting for a word from you
To knock me down, hand me your hand
The hand that threw a kind woo
I can't stop loving you

here it comes, here it comes
I can see the hills exploding
exploding gracefully, pulling up the big black slick
here it comes
we invite you, we invite you
we invite you to the greatest shindig of the world
we invite you, we invite you
we invite you to the greatest shindig of the world
inside it’s swimsuit
well I’m a vegan
free to dance for you
almost crowds you

see outside your earthquake
I’m sick of ???
and make them happy to be alive
we invite you, we invite you
we invite you to the greatest shindig of the world
we invite you, we invite you
we invite you to the greatest shindig of the world

She said she wanted more of that stuff
The stuff that makes your heart, your heart go pitter-pat
The stuff that makes everything turn blue and green
She said that she prefers it like that
Give it up
Give it uh-uh-up
Give it up
Hey
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Give it up
Ha, ha, ha
Give it up
Up, up, up, up, up, up, hey

So many people starving and fighting
Too many salesmen
Too many batteries
Says she likes getting high because it's free
Give it up
Give it uh-uh-up
Give it up
Hey
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Give it up

Hey

funny how it soothed me
in someone else's laundry
when I think it's wishing wearing men
beer is cheap and clap free
and you won't know when you won't stay
and I'm sorry because I'm there
but everybody says
it's life with a big F
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
mister beetle is half awake
but I won't let them say my name
yeah I won't pay them money that I owe
though she don't play no tricks on me
I've got my liberty
I got this uzi and my French
but everybody says
it's life with a big F
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
french!

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
If they think they can tell us all of their problems
If they think we'd listen if we had a clue, yeah
Well I'm going to tell them something that's good and evil, yeah
If we don't then we'll give in to something far too strong
So keep strong, keep strong
Going deeper and deeper into the debt
Going deeper and deeper into depression
All the time they're making you bad, boy, boy, boy, boy
All the time they're making you bad, boy
So keep strong, keep strong
Anyone can be a millionaire
Anyone can have a big black car and a phone
(Yes, yes, yes)
Because it's just as easy, they?ll rot in hell
Because it's just as easy, they're all fat bastards and
Nothing at all, keep strong
Hey
Hey
Keep strong, keep strong
Yeah, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, and if you want to be rich
Then you got to be a bastard
But, but if you can't be a bastard
Then you might as well just sit in front of your television
And spend the rest of your life like a fucking zombie
Keep strong, keep strong

Rain magic up down America
And on comes our man
With a smile that's taken years to fix
Spreading pestilence and disease
To those old women
Who couldn't know no difference
And now I know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who gets it done?
Sell me the burning bush
Tell me I'm burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush
I believe in feeling for the next ones
The ones who cannot cope
It's a land full of heart attacks
Money builds McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The corporations own the very air that you breath
And I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who drops the bomb
The one who gets it done?
Tell me I'm burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who drops the bomb
The one who gets it done?
Tell me I'm burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush

Tell me bitch
Are you screwing that small grey spanish old man
Kind of vicious little mouth
If you are then he just might meet with an accident
'cause I know I don't wanna see his face again
Tell me bitch
Are you screwing that little spanish man
Ever since you left me I've been so dull I mean so ill
I don't know what to do with myself
Tell me bitch
Is he good in bed
Is he better than me
Well that's not difficult really
'cause I haven't got a willy

Boo
Check it out
Here comes the big man, fat man
He's going to huff and puff and blow you out
Sooner or later
You're going to kiss the ground you watch
Open up and let the good man in
Here comes the big man
And he's going to lick in your bones
Like the kids at the door
And the killer comes down the lair with 16 million greeting cards
Welcome to new generation (Hi!)
It's a colour addiction (Soda!)
Welcome to new generation, yeah
It's a colour addiction (Bubble!)
Eight men play God right next to your country
Steal our children
Ask myself
I'd like to teach the world
To sing a brand new harmony
Skin them up and spit them out
And burn them with the trees
I want to paint the world on coke
I think that I need your help (Blah!)
Welcome to new generation
It's a colour addiction (Ah!)
Welcome to new generation, yeah
It's a colour addiction (Ah!)
Smile for the cameras, boys and girls
Welcome to new generation
(Come to the new generation, boys and girls in Europe)
Know colour addiction
(The whole new Norway of opportunity)
Welcome to new generation
(Just step right up and buy your chickens)
Cool, colour addiction

And the wise men say "I don't want to hear your voice."
And the thin men say "I don't want to hear your voice."
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be.
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
And my mother say "We spit on your son some more."
And the buildings say "We spit on your face some more."
And the feeling is that there's something wrong,
'cause I can't find the words, and I can't find the songs.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint,
can't remember what it is,
doesn't matter anyway.
Doesn't matter anyway.
 

Please forget the words that I just blurted out,
it wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt,
it keeps rattling my cage.
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down,
and even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Soon your things that keep, that keep me underground,
so many words that I, that I can never find.
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't,
even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
 

Nothing touches me, man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldn't take one of them little drills to get through it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went
Nothing touches me
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me, man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So I've given up looking out of it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now

Been thinking about you, your records are here,
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.
But I'm still no-one, and you're now a star,
what do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,
shit I still love you, still see you in bed.
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
when the other men are far, far better.
All the things you've got,
all the things you need,
who bought you cigarettes,
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet.
They don't know what I know and why should you care
when I'm not there.
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,
should I still love you, still see you in bed.
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care,
when I'm not there.
All the things you've got,
she'll never need,
all the things you've got.
I've bled and I bleed to please you.
 

i got wings, i got arms, i got shrinks
i got bombs, i got guns, i got brains
so there's no point in your warbird
she's no point in denying
i got guns, i got bombs, i got brains
and i won't fall for you
and i won't fall for you
take me up to a warmer place
i got eggs, i got feathers, i got brains
and there's no point in your warbird
she's no point in denying
i got bombs, i got guns, i got brains
and i won't fall for you
and i won't fall for you
for you
for you
or you
or...
i got brains, i got feathers, i got hands,
i got friends, i got ammo, i got plans
so there's no point in your warbird
she's no point in denying
i got guns, i got arms, i got plans
and i won't fall for you
and i won't fall for you
and i won't fall for you
and i won't fly for you

You are the sun and moon and stars are you,
and I could never run away from you.
You try at working out chaotic things,
and why should I believe myself not you?
It's like the world is going to end so soon,
and why should I believe myself?
You me and everything caught in the fire,
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.
You me and everything caught in the fire,
and I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.
Drill EP lyrics: 
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?
You say the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Hey, the sun and moon and stars are
Yeah, but I won't share myself with you, you
To, me, ooh...

Drift all you like
From ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions
And hijacked affairs will
Just make you more alone
If you come home
I'll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me
Dressed for the kill
What a nasty surprise
You're my man-o-war
And the worms will come for you
Big Boots
So unplug the phones
Stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
From poisoned cloud
To poisoned dwarf
What a nasty surprise
You're my man-o-war
And the worms will come for you
Big boots
Yeah the worms will come for you
Big boots

I see you in the dark
falling down the fast lane
calling out to me
oh that's where i'll be
crawling out to me
crawling out to me
you follow me around
you follow me around
you follow me around
you follow me around
even when your coming down
and i'll take you for a walk
then i can see you
I'm feeling it coming down
you follow me around
you follow me around
you follow me around
you follow me around
I feel it
I feel it

Alt version played in Toronto in 2000:
I see you in the dark corner of the street
Coming after me, yeah
Headlights on full-beam
Coming down the fast lane
Coming after me, yeah
I would like to change back now
To the shadow of
The shadow of my former self
It follows me around (x2)
Did you lie to us Tony?
We thought you were different
Now you know we're not so sure
Drooling looney tunes
Moving in a swarm
Moving in a swarm
It follows me around (x4)
Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothing
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink
You follow me around (x2)
Follow me around (x2)

I won't run away no more, I promise
Even when I get bored, I promise
Even when you lock me out, I promise
I say my prayers every night, I promise
I don't wish that I'm strict, I promise
The tantrums and the chilling chats, I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck, I promise
I won't fool around no more, I promise
Even when I get bored, I promise
Even when you lock me out, I promise
I say my prayers every night, I promise
I won't fool around no more, I promise

This is the place
Remember me?
I'm the face you always see
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you
This is the place
It won't hurt, it will not hurt
A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
Cos it's time to go home
Only one, only one
Only one, only one
Only one, only one
Only one (??)
You've been stuck in a lift
In a belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean
A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
Cos it's time to go home
Only one, only one
Only one, only one
Only one, only one
Only one (??)

Original lyrics:
This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won't hurt, it will not hurt
A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
Cos it's time to go home
This is the place
Remembering all the things you always see
You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean
A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
Cos it's time to go home
A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
Cos it's time to go home
Today is the first day of the rest of your days
So lighten up squirt

This dance
This dance
It's like a weapon
Like a weapon
Of self defense
Self defense
Against the present
Against the present
Present tense
I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'm dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around when the penny drops
I won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
Stop from falling
Down a mine
It’s no one’s business but mine
That all this love
Could be in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost

Don't bore us
Get to the chorus
Open the floodgates
We want the good bits
Without the bullshit
And no heartache
Hold on
Hold on
No pain and
No suffering
And no one gets hurt
We absorb you
We absolve you
Open the floodgates
Hold on
Hold on

When we realize we're only to die then we're out of here
We're just skirting on the surface
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear
We're just skirting on the surface
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface
When we realize we're only held in suspension
Until someone comes along and shakes us
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web
Will we die upon the surface?
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

The moon is a rock on a mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing we're here to keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail,
Together
Together
You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
Paid off security and got through the gate
You got away with it but we lie in wait
Where's the truth? What's the use?
I'm hanging around lost and found
And when you're here, innocent
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you're not right
You're fast to lose, you will lose
You jumped the queue, go back again
President for life, lord of all
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
The fish in the sea, you've lost command

You're the cream in my airport-coffees
You're the light wiping out my batteries
I don't know why I stick with you
If I had a choice
Like lambs into the slaughter
Like cows to the thunderbolt
You're the genie of my lamp
I could have been anyone
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
Like this...
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
If you try to strangle the skylark
Try to cut it up, to see how it works
You will stop his heart from beating
You will stop his mouth from singing
Come inside my heart
Walk down the corridors
Stalagmites and stalactites
Rows of never open doors
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
I did...

I walk down the staircase,
Magnetic pull.
Back to the other place
That I cannot go.
I'm sending a chopper,
To steal you away.
The pot is full,
Let me take control,
Let me take control.
The pot is full
Of secrets to be told,
Secrets to be told.
Out of orbit
And I always will.
The pot is full,
Let me take control,
Let me take control.
The pot is full
Of secrets to be told,
Secrets to be told
